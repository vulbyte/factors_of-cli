# factors_of-cli

just a little command line tool to save having to manually have to factor numbers as it can be a pain in the ass

## download link:

[download compiled for appleSilicone](https://github.com/vulbyte/factors_of-cli/raw/master/target/release/factors_of)

## optional flags:

`-all` to print inversion, aka, by default factors_of ignores any number where a < b, so it will then include nyumbers past a > b

`-tests` to print the current number being tested, not practical, but can be used for debugging, or simply to monitor really long tiles

### todo:

add an sh script which easily adds the command as an alias to your ~/.zshrc
